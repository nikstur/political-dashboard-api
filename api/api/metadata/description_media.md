Data about the political landscape of the traditional media.

The data is collected by directly scraping the websites of 40 prominent news media
sites. The media outlets were selected according to these guidelines:

- Media outlets from all political orientations should be included
- The sites with the most online traffic should be included (according to alexa.com)
- Only media outlets that use RSS feeds to announce articles were considered (because
  these RSS feeds are used to monitor new articles)
