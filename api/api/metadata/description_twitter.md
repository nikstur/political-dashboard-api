Data about the political landscape on Twitter.

The data is collected by querying the Twitter streaming API with 239 hashtags and
13,633 users as parameters. Relevant users are bloggers, correspondents, journalists,
parties, politicians etc. The selected hashtags fall into one of four categories:

- political parties (e.g. #cdu, #gr√ºnen)
- general politics (#finanzpolitik, #bundestag)
- media sites (e.g. #spiegel, #bild)
- politicians (e.g. #merkel, #gauland)

Not only the tweets themselves are collected but also mentions and retweets.

Please keep in mind that the Twitter API does not provide all tweets matched by
the query and thus the data can potentially be skewed. However, due to the sheer
number of available data in the database this threat to inference is somewhat
mitigated.
